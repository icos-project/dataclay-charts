1. Run applications within kubernetes through the Service created in this chart.

To get the list of available services:

kubectl get svc \
    --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} \
    --selector "app=mds"

And an application inside kubernetes can use dataClay by using as host this:

    from dataclay import Client
    client = Client(host="mds-dataclay", 
                    username="testuser",
                    password="s3cret", 
                    dataset="testdata")
    client.start()

The service mds-dataclay is the default, but it may differ if you changed chart values.
Same happens with dataClay credentials such as username, password and dataset.
